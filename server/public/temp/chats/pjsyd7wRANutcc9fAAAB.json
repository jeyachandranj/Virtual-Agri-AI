It's all about promoting natural processes and soil health. Farmers use natural methods to control pests, like integrated pest management, and compost to enrich the soil. The result?

In farming, machine learning can help with crop monitoring, disease detection, and even predicting yields. It's like having a super-smart farmhand that can analyze data and make adjustments on the fly. Farmers can use machine learning algorithms to optimize irrigation, fertilization, and pest control â€“ it's a game-changer!\"",
